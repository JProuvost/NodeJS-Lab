    <p>
        This is the home page of the second lab of Node JS. It explains how the lab works.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project has one URL <mark>/hello/yourname</mark>. The purpose of the page is only to render
        your name. <mark>There will be also a button to get some metrics (Current Date, Current Time).</mark>
        If you enter Jean, there will be a short introduction of myself!
    
        Any other url will be considered as an error. The server will react to this by rendering a 404 page!
